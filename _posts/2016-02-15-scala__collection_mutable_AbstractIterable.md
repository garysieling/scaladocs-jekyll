    values are used to pad the result. If `that` is shorter than this iterable

### `def par: ParIterable[A]`                                                ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

* returns
  * a parallel implementation of this collection

* Definition Classes

### `def ++:[B >: A, That](that: collection.Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Iterable[A], B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the
    element type `B` being admissible for that class, which means that an
    implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is found.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and and the new element
    type `B` .
* returns
  * a new collection of type `That` which contains all elements of this
    traversable collection followed by all elements of `that` .

### `def ++:[B >: A, That](that: TraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Iterable[A], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* returns

    collection followed by all elements of `that` .

* Definition Classes

### `def ++[B >: A, That](that: GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Iterable[A], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Returns a new iterable collection containing the elements from the left hand
operand followed by the elements from the right hand operand. The element type
of the iterable collection is the most specific superclass encompassing the
element types of the two operands.

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = List(2)
b: List[Int] = List(2)

scala> val c = a ++ b
c: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> val d = List('a')
d: List[Char] = List(a)

scala> val e = c ++ d
e: List[AnyVal] = List(1, 2, a)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* returns
  * a new iterable collection which contains all elements of this iterable
    collection followed by all elements of `that` .

[use case]

Builds a new collection by applying a partial function to all elements of this
iterable collection on which the function is defined.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* pf
  * the partial function which filters and maps the iterable collection.
* returns
  * a new iterable collection resulting from applying the given partial function
     `pf` to each element on which it is defined and collecting the results. The
    order of the elements is preserved.

### `def dropWhile(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): Iterable[A]`                           ###

Drops longest prefix of elements that satisfy a predicate.

### `def filter(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): Iterable[A]`                              ###

Selects all elements of this traversable collection which satisfy a predicate.

* p
  * the predicate used to test elements.
* returns
  * a new traversable collection consisting of all elements of this traversable
    collection that satisfy the given predicate `p` . The order of the elements
    is preserved.

* Definition Classes

Selects all elements of this traversable collection which do not satisfy a
predicate.

* p

(defined at scala.collection.TraversableLike)


### `def flatMap[B, That](f: (A) ⇒ GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Iterable[A], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Builds a new collection by applying a function to all elements of this iterable
collection and using the elements of the resulting collections.

For example:

```scala
def getWords(lines: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = lines flatMap (line => line split "\\W+")
```

The type of the resulting collection is guided by the static type of iterable
collection. This might cause unexpected results sometimes. For example:

```scala
// lettersOf will return a Seq[Char] of likely repeated letters, instead of a Set
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words flatMap (word => word.toSet)

// lettersOf will return a Set[Char], not a Seq
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words.toSet flatMap (word => word.toSeq)

// xs will be an Iterable[Int]

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

the map. Duplicate keys will be overwritten by later keys: if this is an
unordered collection, which key is in the resulting map is undefined.

// ys == Vector(
