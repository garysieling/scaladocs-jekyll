```scala
trait SeqProxyLike[+A, +Repr <: SeqLike[A, Repr] with Seq[A]] extends SeqLike[A, Repr] with IterableProxyLike[A, Repr]
```

This trait implements a proxy for sequences. It forwards all calls to a
different sequence.

### `def equals(that: Any): Boolean`                                         ###

Compares the receiver object ( `this` ) with the argument object ( `that` ) for
equivalence.

Any implementation of this method should be an
[equivalence relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation) :

* It is reflexive: for any instance `x` of type `Any` , `x.equals(x)` should
   return `true` .
* It is symmetric: for any instances `x` and `y` of type `Any` , `x.equals(y)`
   should return `true` if and only if `y.equals(x)` returns `true` .
* It is transitive: for any instances `x` , `y` , and `z` of type `Any` if
    `x.equals(y)` returns `true` and `y.equals(z)` returns `true` , then
    `x.equals(z)` should return `true` .

If you override this method, you should verify that your implementation remains
an equivalence relation. Additionally, when overriding this method it is usually
necessary to override `hashCode` to ensure that objects which are "equal" (
 `o1.equals(o2)` returns `true` ) hash to the same scala.Int. (
 `o1.hashCode.equals(o2.hashCode)` ).

* that
  * the object to compare against this object for equality.
* returns
  * `true` if the receiver object is equivalent to the argument; `false`
    otherwise.

### `def par: ParSeq[A]`                                                     ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

* returns
  * a parallel implementation of this collection

### `def combinations(n: Int): Iterator[Repr]`                               ###

Iterates over combinations. A _combination_ of length `n` is a subsequence of
the original sequence, with the elements taken in order. Thus, `"xy"` and
 `"yy"` are both length-2 combinations of `"xyy"` , but `"yx"` is not. If there
is more than one way to generate the same subsequence, only one will be
returned.

For example, `"xyyy"` has three different ways to generate `"xy"` depending on
whether the first, second, or third `"y"` is selected. However, since all are
identical, only one will be chosen. Which of the three will be taken is an
implementation detail that is not defined.

* returns
  * An Iterator which traverses the possible n-element combinations of this
    sequence.

* Definition Classes

```scala
"abbbc".combinations(2) = Iterator(ab, ac, bb, bc)

create a new parallel collection.

### `def +:[B >: A, That](elem: B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

A copy of the sequence with an element prepended.

Note that :-ending operators are right associative (see example). A mnemonic for
 `+:` vs. `:+` is: the COLon goes on the COLlection side.

Also, the original sequence is not modified, so you will want to capture the
result.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = 2 +: x
y: List[Int] = List(2, 1)

scala> println(x)
List(1)
```

  * the prepended element

### `def :+[B >: A, That](elem: B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

A copy of this sequence with an element appended.

A mnemonic for `+:` vs. `:+` is: the COLon goes on the COLlection side.

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = a :+ 2
b: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> println(a)
List(1)

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

scala> x(3)

### `def ++:[B >: A, That](that: Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B

### `def withFilter(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): FilterMonadic[A, Repr]`               ###

Creates a non-strict filter of this traversable collection.

Note: the difference between `c filter p` and `c withFilter p` is that the
former creates a new collection, whereas the latter only restricts the domain of
subsequent `map` , `flatMap` , `foreach` , and `withFilter` operations.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* p

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

* returns
  * a set containing all elements of this traversable collection.

* Definition Classes
  * TraversableProxyLike → TraversableOnce → GenTraversableOnce

(defined at scala.collection.TraversableProxyLike)

### `def toParArray: ParArray[T]`                                            ###

* Implicit information
  * This member is added by an implicit conversion from SeqProxyLike [A, Repr]
    to CollectionsHaveToParArray [SeqProxyLike [A, Repr], T] performed by method
    CollectionsHaveToParArray in scala.collection.parallel. This conversion will
    take place only if an implicit value of type (SeqProxyLike [A, Repr]) ⇒
    GenTraversableOnce [T] is in scope.
* Definition Classes
  * CollectionsHaveToParArray
(added by implicit convertion: scala.collection.parallel.CollectionsHaveToParArray)
