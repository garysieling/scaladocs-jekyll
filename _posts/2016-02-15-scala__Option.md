```scala
sealed abstract class Option[+A] extends Product with Serializable
```

Represents optional values. Instances of `Option` are either an instance of
scala.Some or the object `None` .

The most idiomatic way to use an scala.Option instance is to treat it as a
collection or monad and use `map` , `flatMap` , `filter` , or `foreach` :

```scala
val name: Option[String] = request getParameter "name"
val upper = name map { _.trim } filter { _.length != 0 } map { _.toUpperCase }
println(upper getOrElse "")
```

Note that this is equivalent to

```scala
val upper = for {
  name <- request getParameter "name"
  trimmed <- Some(name.trim)
  upper <- Some(trimmed.toUpperCase) if trimmed.length != 0
} yield upper
println(upper getOrElse "")
```

Because of how for comprehension works, if `None` is returned from
 `request.getParameter` , the entire expression results in `None`

This allows for sophisticated chaining of scala.Option values without having to
check for the existence of a value.

A less-idiomatic way to use scala.Option values is via pattern matching:

```scala
val nameMaybe = request getParameter "name"
nameMaybe match {
  case Some(name) =>
    println(name.trim.toUppercase)
  case None =>
    println("No name value")
}
```

### `class WithFilter extends AnyRef`                                        ###

We need a whole WithFilter class to honor the "doesn't create a new collection"
contract even though it seems unlikely to matter much in a collection with max
size 1.

### `def ++:[B >: A, That](that: collection.Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[collection.Iterable[A], B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the
    element type `B` being admissible for that class, which means that an
    implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is found.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and and the new element
    type `B` .
* returns
  * a new collection of type `That` which contains all elements of this iterable
    collection followed by all elements of `that` .

* Implicit information
  * This member is added by an implicit conversion from Option [A] to Iterable [

[use case]

Returns a new option containing the elements from the left hand operand followed
by the elements from the right hand operand. The element type of the option is
the most specific superclass encompassing the element types of the two operands.

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = List(2)
b: List[Int] = List(2)

scala> val c = a ++ b

```

### `def /:[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) ⇒ B): B`                                     ###

Applies a binary operator to a start value and all elements of this iterable
collection, going left to right.

Note: `/:` is alternate syntax for `foldLeft` ; `z /: xs` is the same as
 `xs foldLeft z` .

Examples:

Note that the folding function used to compute b is equivalent to that used to
compute c.

```scala
scala> val a = List(1,2,3,4)
a: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val b = (5 /: a)(_+_)
b: Int = 15

scala> val c = (5 /: a)((x,y) => x + y)
c: Int = 15
```

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered. or the operator is associative and commutative.

* B
  * the result type of the binary operator.
* z
  * the start value.
* op
  * the binary operator.
* returns
  * the result of inserting `op` between consecutive elements of this iterable
    collection, going left to right with the start value `z` on the left:

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the iterable collection into partitions and processes each
partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like `foldLeft` ).
Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop` (like `fold` ).
The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary number of
collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an arbitrary number
of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

Note: may not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying

### `def par: ParIterable[A]`                                                ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

* returns
  * a parallel implementation of this collection

  * This member is added by an implicit conversion from Option [A] to Iterable [

This method returns a reference to this collection. In parallel collections, it
is redefined to return a sequential implementation of this collection. In both
cases, it has O(1) complexity.

* returns
  * a sequential view of the collection.

### `def slice(from: Int, until: Int): collection.Iterable[A]`               ###

Selects an interval of elements. The returned collection is made up of all
elements `x` which satisfy the invariant:

```scala
from <= indexOf(x) < until
```

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* returns
  * a iterable collection containing the elements greater than or equal to index
     `from` extending up to (but not including) index `until` of this iterable
    collection.

### `def sliding(size: Int): collection.Iterator[collection.Iterable[A]]`    ###

by default.

  * An iterator producing iterable collections of size `size` , except the last
    and the only element will be truncated if there are fewer elements than
    size.

collection type is ordered.
