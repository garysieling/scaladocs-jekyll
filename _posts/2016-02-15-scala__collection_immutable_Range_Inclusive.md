### `def compose[A](g: (A) ⇒ Int): (A) ⇒ Int`                                ###

Composes two instances of Function1 in a new Function1, with this function
applied last.

* A
  * the type to which function `g` can be applied
* g
  * a function A => T1
* returns
  * a new function `f` such that `f(x) == apply(g(x))`

### `def andThen[C](k: (Int) ⇒ C): PartialFunction[Int, C]`                  ###

Composes this partial function with a transformation function that gets applied
to results of this partial function.

* C
  * the result type of the transformation function.
* k
  * the transformation function
* returns
  * a partial function with the same domain as this partial function, which maps
    arguments `x` to `k(this(x))` .

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction → Function1

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def applyOrElse[A1 <: Int, B1 >: Int](x: A1, default: (A1) ⇒ B1): B1`   ###

Applies this partial function to the given argument when it is contained in the
function domain. Applies fallback function where this partial function is not
defined.

Note that expression `pf.applyOrElse(x, default)` is equivalent to

```scala
if(pf isDefinedAt x) pf(x) else default(x)
```

except that `applyOrElse` method can be implemented more efficiently. For all
partial function literals the compiler generates an `applyOrElse` implementation
which avoids double evaluation of pattern matchers and guards. This makes
 `applyOrElse` the basis for the efficient implementation for many operations
and scenarios, such as:

* combining partial functions into `orElse` / `andThen` chains does not lead to
   excessive `apply` / `isDefinedAt` evaluation
*  `lift` and `unlift` do not evaluate source functions twice on each invocation
*  `runWith` allows efficient imperative-style combining of partial functions
   with conditionally applied actions

For non-literal partial function classes with nontrivial `isDefinedAt` method it
is recommended to override `applyOrElse` with custom implementation that avoids
double `isDefinedAt` evaluation. This may result in better performance and more
predictable behavior w.r.t. side effects.

* x
  * the function argument
* default
  * the fallback function
* returns
  * the result of this function or fallback function application.

### `def lift: (Int) ⇒ Option[Int]`                                          ###

Turns this partial function into a plain function returning an `Option` result.

* returns
  * a function that takes an argument `x` to `Some(this(x))` if `this` is
    defined for `x` , and to `None` otherwise.

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction
* See also
  * Function.unlift

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def orElse[A1 <: Int, B1 >: Int](that: PartialFunction[A1, B1]): PartialFunction[A1, B1]` ###

Composes this partial function with a fallback partial function which gets
applied where this partial function is not defined.

* A1
  * the argument type of the fallback function
* B1
  * the result type of the fallback function
* that
  * the fallback function
* returns
  * a partial function which has as domain the union of the domains of this
    partial function and `that` . The resulting partial function takes `x` to
     `this(x)` where `this` is defined, and to `that(x)` where it is not.

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def runWith[U](action: (Int) ⇒ U): (Int) ⇒ Boolean`                     ###

Composes this partial function with an action function which gets applied to
results of this partial function. The action function is invoked only for its
side effects; its result is ignored.

Note that expression `pf.runWith(action)(x)` is equivalent to

```scala
if(pf isDefinedAt x) { action(pf(x)); true } else false
```

except that `runWith` is implemented via `applyOrElse` and thus potentially more
efficient. Using `runWith` avoids double evaluation of pattern matchers and
guards for partial function literals.

* action
  * the action function
* returns
  * a function which maps arguments `x` to `isDefinedAt(x)` . The resulting
    function runs `action(this(x))` where `this` is defined.

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction
* Since
  * 2.10
* See also
  * `applyOrElse` .

### `def +:[B >: Int, That](elem: B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[IndexedSeq[Int], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

A copy of the range with an element prepended.

Note that :-ending operators are right associative (see example). A mnemonic for
 `+:` vs. `:+` is: the COLon goes on the COLlection side.

Also, the original range is not modified, so you will want to capture the
result.

scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = 2 +: x
y: List[Int] = List(2, 1)

scala> println(x)

A mnemonic for `+:` vs. `:+` is: the COLon goes on the COLlection side.

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = a :+ 2
b: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

### `def combinations(n: Int): Iterator[IndexedSeq[Int]]`                    ###

Iterates over combinations. A _combination_ of length `n` is a subsequence of
the original sequence, with the elements taken in order. Thus, `"xy"` and
 `"yy"` are both length-2 combinations of `"xyy"` , but `"yx"` is not. If there
is more than one way to generate the same subsequence, only one will be
returned.

For example, `"xyyy"` has three different ways to generate `"xy"` depending on
whether the first, second, or third `"y"` is selected. However, since all are
identical, only one will be chosen. Which of the three will be taken is an
implementation detail that is not defined.

* returns
  * An Iterator which traverses the possible n-element combinations of this
    sequence.

```scala
"abbbc".combinations(2) = Iterator(ab, ac, bb, bc)

Produces a new sequence which contains all elements of this range and also all
elements of a given sequence. `xs union ys` is equivalent to `xs ++ ys` .

### `def ++:[B >: Int, That](that: collection.Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[IndexedSeq[Int], B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the

    implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is found.
* that
  * the traversable to append.

  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and and the new element

using the elements of the resulting collections.

For example:

```scala
def getWords(lines: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = lines flatMap (line => line split "\\W+")
```

The type of the resulting collection is guided by the static type of range. This
might cause unexpected results sometimes. For example:

```scala
// lettersOf will return a Seq[Char] of likely repeated letters, instead of a Set
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words flatMap (word => word.toSet)

// lettersOf will return a Set[Char], not a Seq
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words.toSet flatMap (word => word.toSeq)

// xs will be an Iterable[Int]
val xs = Map("a" -> List(11,111), "b" -> List(22,222)).flatMap(_._2)

// ys will be a Map[Int, Int]
val ys = Map("a" -> List(1 -> 11,1 -> 111), "b" -> List(2 -> 22,2 -> 222)).flatMap(_._2)

Partitions this traversable collection into a map of traversable collections

Note: this method is not re-implemented by views. This means when applied to a

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, Int) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`   ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

### `def flatten[B](implicit asTraversable: (Int) ⇒ GenTraversableOnce[B]): IndexedSeq[B]` ###

[use case]

Converts this range of traversable collections into a range formed by the
elements of these traversable collections.

The resulting collection's type will be guided by the static type of range. For
example:

```scala
val xs = List(
           Set(1, 2, 3),
           Set(1, 2, 3)
         ).flatten
// xs == List(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

val ys = Set(
           List(1, 2, 3),
           List(3, 2, 1)
         ).flatten
// ys == Set(1, 2, 3)
```

### `def par: ParRange`                                                      ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

  * a parallel implementation of this collection

Note: `c span p` is equivalent to (but possibly more efficient than)
 `(c takeWhile p, c dropWhile p)` , provided the evaluation of the predicate
 `p` does not cause any side-effects.

* returns
  * a pair consisting of the longest prefix of this range whose elements all
    satisfy `p` , and the rest of this range.
