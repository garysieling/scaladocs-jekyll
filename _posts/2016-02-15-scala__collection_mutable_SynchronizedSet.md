```scala
trait SynchronizedSet[A] extends Set[A]
```

This class should be used as a mixin. It synchronizes the `Set` functions of the
class into which it is mixed in.

* A
  * type of the elements contained in this synchronized set.

* Annotations
  * @ deprecated
* Deprecated
  * _(Since version 2.11.0)_ Synchronization via traits is deprecated as it is
    inherently unreliable. Consider
    java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap[A,Unit] as an alternative.

### `def par: ParSet[A]`                                                     ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

* returns
  * a parallel implementation of this collection

operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

[use case]

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the

of the synchronized set is the most specific superclass encompassing the element
types of the two operands.

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = List(2)
b: List[Int] = List(2)

scala> val c = a ++ b
c: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> val d = List('a')
d: List[Char] = List(a)

scala> val e = c ++ d
e: List[AnyVal] = List(1, 2, a)
```

* B

  * the element type of the returned collection.
* pf
  * the partial function which filters and maps the synchronized set.

### `def flatMap[B, That](f: (A) ⇒ GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Set[A], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

synchronized set and using the elements of the resulting collections.

For example:

```scala
def getWords(lines: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = lines flatMap (line => line split "\\W+")
```

The type of the resulting collection is guided by the static type of
synchronized set. This might cause unexpected results sometimes. For example:

```scala
// lettersOf will return a Seq[Char] of likely repeated letters, instead of a Set
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words flatMap (word => word.toSet)

// lettersOf will return a Set[Char], not a Seq
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words.toSet flatMap (word => word.toSeq)

// xs will be an Iterable[Int]
val xs = Map("a" -> List(11,111), "b" -> List(22,222)).flatMap(_._2)

// ys will be a Map[Int, Int]
val ys = Map("a" -> List(1 -> 11,1 -> 111), "b" -> List(2 -> 22,2 -> 222)).flatMap(_._2)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.

Partitions this traversable collection into a map of traversable collections
according to some discriminator function.

Note: this method is not re-implemented by views. This means when applied to a
view it will always force the view and return a new traversable collection.

* K
  * the type of keys returned by the discriminator function.
* f
  * the discriminator function.
* returns
  * A map from keys to traversable collections such that the following invariant
    holds:

collection, with the intervening values the results of successive applications
of `init` .

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions
