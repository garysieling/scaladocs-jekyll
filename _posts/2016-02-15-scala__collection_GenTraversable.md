### `abstract def ++[B >: A, That](that: GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[GenTraversable[A], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Returns a new collection containing the elements from the left hand operand
followed by the elements from the right hand operand. The element type of the
collection is the most specific superclass encompassing the element types of the
two operands.

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = List(2)
b: List[Int] = List(2)

scala> val c = a ++ b
c: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> val d = List('a')
d: List[Char] = List(a)

scala> val e = c ++ d
e: List[AnyVal] = List(1, 2, a)
```

* B

### `abstract def collect[B, That](pf: PartialFunction[A, B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[GenTraversable[A], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Builds a new collection by applying a partial function to all elements of this
collection on which the function is defined.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* pf
  * the partial function which filters and maps the collection.
* returns
  * a new collection resulting from applying the given partial function `pf` to
    each element on which it is defined and collecting the results. The order of

### `abstract def flatMap[B, That](f: (A) ⇒ GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[GenTraversable[A], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Builds a new collection by applying a function to all elements of this
collection and using the elements of the resulting collections.

For example:

```scala
def getWords(lines: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = lines flatMap (line => line split "\\W+")
```

The type of the resulting collection is guided by the static type of collection.
This might cause unexpected results sometimes. For example:

```scala
// lettersOf will return a Seq[Char] of likely repeated letters, instead of a Set
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words flatMap (word => word.toSet)

// lettersOf will return a Set[Char], not a Seq
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words.toSet flatMap (word => word.toSeq)

// xs will be an Iterable[Int]
val xs = Map("a" -> List(11,111), "b" -> List(22,222)).flatMap(_._2)

// ys will be a Map[Int, Int]
val ys = Map("a" -> List(1 -> 11,1 -> 111), "b" -> List(2 -> 22,2 -> 222)).flatMap(_._2)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* f

  * the element type of the returned collection.

Applies a binary operator to a start value and all elements of this collection
or iterator, going left to right.

Note: `/:` is alternate syntax for `foldLeft` ; `z /: xs` is the same as
 `xs foldLeft z` .

Examples:

Note that the folding function used to compute b is equivalent to that used to
compute c.

```scala

a: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val b = (5 /: a)(_+_)
b: Int = 15

collection type is ordered or the operator is associative and commutative.

* B
  * the result type of the binary operator.
* z
  * the start value.
* op
  * the binary operator.
* returns
  * the result of inserting `op` between consecutive elements of this collection
    or iterator, going left to right with the start value `z` on the left:

    ```scala
    op(...op(op(z, x_1), x_2), ..., x_n)

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered or the operator is associative and commutative.

### `abstract def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B` ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the collection or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

* returns
  * a parallel implementation of this collection

           Set(4, 5, 6)).transpose

val ys = Vector(
           List(1, 2, 3),
           List(4, 5, 6)).transpose
// ys == Vector(
//         Vector(1, 4),
