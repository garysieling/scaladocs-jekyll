```scala
trait ObservableMap[A, B] extends Map[A, B] with Publisher[Message[(A, B)] with Undoable]
```

This class is typically used as a mixin. It adds a subscription mechanism to the
 `Map` class into which this abstract class is mixed in. Class `ObservableMap`
publishes events of the type `Message` .

### `def compose[A](g: (A) ⇒ A): (A) ⇒ B`                                    ###

Composes two instances of Function1 in a new Function1, with this function
applied last.

* A
  * the type to which function `g` can be applied
* g
  * a function A => T1
* returns

### `def andThen[C](k: (B) ⇒ C): PartialFunction[A, C]`                      ###

Composes this partial function with a transformation function that gets applied
to results of this partial function.

* C
  * the result type of the transformation function.
* k
  * the transformation function
* returns
  * a partial function with the same domain as this partial function, which maps
    arguments `x` to `k(this(x))` .

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction → Function1

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def applyOrElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](x: A1, default: (A1) ⇒ B1): B1`       ###

Applies this partial function to the given argument when it is contained in the
function domain. Applies fallback function where this partial function is not
defined.

Note that expression `pf.applyOrElse(x, default)` is equivalent to

```scala
if(pf isDefinedAt x) pf(x) else default(x)
```

except that `applyOrElse` method can be implemented more efficiently. For all
partial function literals the compiler generates an `applyOrElse` implementation
which avoids double evaluation of pattern matchers and guards. This makes
 `applyOrElse` the basis for the efficient implementation for many operations
and scenarios, such as:

* combining partial functions into `orElse` / `andThen` chains does not lead to
   excessive `apply` / `isDefinedAt` evaluation
*  `lift` and `unlift` do not evaluate source functions twice on each invocation
*  `runWith` allows efficient imperative-style combining of partial functions
   with conditionally applied actions

For non-literal partial function classes with nontrivial `isDefinedAt` method it
is recommended to override `applyOrElse` with custom implementation that avoids
double `isDefinedAt` evaluation. This may result in better performance and more
predictable behavior w.r.t. side effects.

* x
  * the function argument
* default
  * the fallback function
* returns
  * the result of this function or fallback function application.

### `def lift: (A) ⇒ Option[B]`                                              ###

Turns this partial function into a plain function returning an `Option` result.

* returns
  * a function that takes an argument `x` to `Some(this(x))` if `this` is
    defined for `x` , and to `None` otherwise.

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction
* See also
  * Function.unlift

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def orElse[A1 <: A, B1 >: B](that: PartialFunction[A1, B1]): PartialFunction[A1, B1]` ###

Composes this partial function with a fallback partial function which gets
applied where this partial function is not defined.

* A1
  * the argument type of the fallback function
* B1
  * the result type of the fallback function
* that
  * the fallback function
* returns
  * a partial function which has as domain the union of the domains of this
    partial function and `that` . The resulting partial function takes `x` to
     `this(x)` where `this` is defined, and to `that(x)` where it is not.

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def runWith[U](action: (B) ⇒ U): (A) ⇒ Boolean`                         ###

Composes this partial function with an action function which gets applied to
results of this partial function. The action function is invoked only for its
side effects; its result is ignored.

Note that expression `pf.runWith(action)(x)` is equivalent to

```scala
if(pf isDefinedAt x) { action(pf(x)); true } else false
```

except that `runWith` is implemented via `applyOrElse` and thus potentially more
efficient. Using `runWith` avoids double evaluation of pattern matchers and
guards for partial function literals.

* action
  * the action function
* returns
  * a function which maps arguments `x` to `isDefinedAt(x)` . The resulting
    function runs `action(this(x))` where `this` is defined.

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction
* Since
  * 2.10
* See also
  * `applyOrElse` .

Retrieves the value which is associated with the given key. This method invokes
the `default` method of the map if there is no mapping from the given key to a
value. Unless overridden, the `default` method throws a
 `NoSuchElementException` .

* key
  * the key

### `def filterKeys(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): collection.Map[A, B]`                 ###

Filters this map by retaining only keys satisfying a predicate.

 *Note* : the predicate must accept any key of type `A` , not just those already
present in the map, as the predicate is tested before the underlying map is
queried.

* p
  * the predicate used to test keys
* returns
  * an immutable map consisting only of those key value pairs of this map where
    the key satisfies the predicate `p` . The resulting map wraps the original
    map without copying any elements.

### `def filterNot(p: ((A, B)) ⇒ Boolean): Map[A, B]`                        ###

Returns a new map obtained by removing all key/value pairs for which the
predicate `p` returns `true` .

 *Note:* This method works by successively removing elements for which the
predicate is true from this set. If removal is slow, or you expect that most
elements of the set will be removed, you might consider using `filter` with a
negated predicate instead.

* p
  * A predicate over key-value pairs

### `def par: ParMap[A, B]`                                                  ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

* returns
  * a parallel implementation of this collection

### `def ++:[B >: (A, B), That](that: collection.Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the
    element type `B` being admissible for that class, which means that an
    implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is found.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and and the new element
    type `B` .
* returns
  * a new collection of type `That` which contains all elements of this
    traversable collection followed by all elements of `that` .

* Definition Classes

### `def ++:[B >: (A, B), That](that: TraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* returns
  * a new mutable map which contains all elements of this mutable map followed
    by all elements of `that` .

* Definition Classes
  * TraversableLike

(defined at scala.collection.TraversableLike)


### `def ++[B >: (A, B), That](that: GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Returns a new mutable map containing the elements from the left hand operand
followed by the elements from the right hand operand. The element type of the
mutable map is the most specific superclass encompassing the element types of
the two operands.

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = List(2)
b: List[Int] = List(2)

scala> val c = a ++ b
c: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> val d = List('a')
d: List[Char] = List(a)

scala> val e = c ++ d
e: List[AnyVal] = List(1, 2, a)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* returns
  * a new mutable map which contains all elements of this mutable map followed
    by all elements of `that` .

### `def collect[B, That](pf: PartialFunction[(A, B), B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Builds a new collection by applying a partial function to all elements of this
mutable map on which the function is defined.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* pf
  * the partial function which filters and maps the mutable map.
* returns
  * a new mutable map resulting from applying the given partial function `pf` to
    each element on which it is defined and collecting the results. The order of
    the elements is preserved.

### `def filter(p: ((A, B)) ⇒ Boolean): Map[A, B]`                           ###

Selects all elements of this traversable collection which satisfy a predicate.

* p
  * the predicate used to test elements.
* returns
  * a new traversable collection consisting of all elements of this traversable
    collection that satisfy the given predicate `p` . The order of the elements
    is preserved.

### `def flatMap[B, That](f: ((A, B)) ⇒ GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Map[A, B], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Builds a new collection by applying a function to all elements of this mutable
map and using the elements of the resulting collections.

For example:

```scala
def getWords(lines: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = lines flatMap (line => line split "\\W+")
```

The type of the resulting collection is guided by the static type of mutable
map. This might cause unexpected results sometimes. For example:

```scala
// lettersOf will return a Seq[Char] of likely repeated letters, instead of a Set
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words flatMap (word => word.toSet)

// lettersOf will return a Set[Char], not a Seq
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words.toSet flatMap (word => word.toSeq)

// xs will be an Iterable[Int]
val xs = Map("a" -> List(11,111), "b" -> List(22,222)).flatMap(_._2)

// ys will be a Map[Int, Int]
val ys = Map("a" -> List(1 -> 11,1 -> 111), "b" -> List(2 -> 22,2 -> 222)).flatMap(_._2)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* f
  * the function to apply to each element.
* returns
  * a new mutable map resulting from applying the given collection-valued
    function `f` to each element of this mutable map and concatenating the
    results.

### `def groupBy[K](f: ((A, B)) ⇒ K): immutable.Map[K, Map[A, B]]`           ###

Partitions this traversable collection into a map of traversable collections
according to some discriminator function.

Note: this method is not re-implemented by views. This means when applied to a
view it will always force the view and return a new traversable collection.

* K
  * the type of keys returned by the discriminator function.
* f
  * the discriminator function.
* returns
  * A map from keys to traversable collections such that the following invariant
    holds:

    ```scala
    (xs groupBy f)(k) = xs filter (x => f(x) == k)
    ```

    That is, every key `k` is bound to a traversable collection of those
    elements `x` for which `f(x)` equals `k` .

### `def withFilter(p: ((A, B)) ⇒ Boolean): FilterMonadic[(A, B), Map[A, B]]` ###

Creates a non-strict filter of this traversable collection.

Note: the difference between `c filter p` and `c withFilter p` is that the
former creates a new collection, whereas the latter only restricts the domain of
subsequent `map` , `flatMap` , `foreach` , and `withFilter` operations.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* p
  * the predicate used to test elements.
* returns
  * an object of class `WithFilter` , which supports `map` , `flatMap` ,
     `foreach` , and `withFilter` operations. All these operations apply to
    those elements of this traversable collection which satisfy the predicate
     `p` .

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, (A, B)) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B` ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions
