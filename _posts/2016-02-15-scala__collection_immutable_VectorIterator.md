### `class GroupedIterator[B >: A] extends AbstractIterator[Seq[B]] with Iterator[Seq[B]]` ###

A flexible iterator for transforming an `Iterator[A]` into an Iterator[Seq[A]],
with configurable sequence size, step, and strategy for dealing with elements
which don't fit evenly.

Typical uses can be achieved via methods `grouped` and `sliding` .

Creates an iterator formed from this iterator and another iterator by combining
corresponding values in pairs. If one of the two iterators is longer than the
other, its remaining elements are ignored.

* that
  * The iterator providing the second half of each result pair
* returns
  * a new iterator containing pairs consisting of corresponding elements of this
    iterator and `that` . The number of elements returned by the new iterator is
    the minimum of the number of elements returned by this iterator and `that` .

compute c.

b: Int = 15

scala> val c = (5 /: a)((x,y) => x + y)
c: Int = 15

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions
