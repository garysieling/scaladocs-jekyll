### `case class Deadline extends Ordered[Deadline] with Product with Serializable` ###

This class stores a deadline, as obtained via `Deadline.now` or the duration
DSL:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._
3.seconds.fromNow
```

Its main purpose is to manage repeated attempts to achieve something (like
awaiting a condition) by offering the methods `hasTimeLeft` and `timeLeft` . All
durations are measured according to `System.nanoTime` aka wall-time; this does
not take into account changes to the system clock (such as leap seconds).

### `sealed abstract class Duration extends Serializable with Ordered[Duration]` ###

### Utility for working with java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit durations.

 * _This class is not meant as a general purpose representation of time, it is
optimized for the needs of `scala.concurrent` ._*

### Basic Usage

Examples:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val duration = Duration(100, MILLISECONDS)
val duration = Duration(100, "millis")

duration.toNanos
duration < 1.second
duration <= Duration.Inf
```

 * _Invoking inexpressible conversions (like calling `toSeconds` on an infinite
duration) will throw an IllegalArgumentException._*

Implicits are also provided for Int, Long and Double. Example usage:

```scala
import scala.concurrent.duration._

val duration = 100 millis
```

 * _The DSL provided by the implicit conversions always allows construction of
finite durations, even for infinite Double inputs; use Duration.Inf instead._*

Extractors, parsing and arithmetic are also included:

```scala
val d = Duration("1.2 Âµs")
val Duration(length, unit) = 5 millis
val d2 = d * 2.5
val d3 = d2 + 1.millisecond
```

### Handling of Time Units

Calculations performed on finite durations always retain the more precise unit
of either operand, no matter whether a coarser unit would be able to exactly
express the same duration. This means that Duration can be used as a lossless
container for a (length, unit) pair if it is constructed using the corresponding
methods and no arithmetic is performed on it; adding/subtracting durations
should in that case be done with care.

### Correspondence to Double Semantics

The semantics of arithmetic operations on Duration are two-fold:

* exact addition/subtraction with nanosecond resolution for finite durations,
   independent of the summands' magnitude
* isomorphic to `java.lang.Double` when it comes to infinite or undefined values

The conversion between Duration and Double is done using Duration.toUnit (with
unit NANOSECONDS) and Duration.fromNanos(Double)

### Ordering

The default ordering is consistent with the ordering of Double numbers, which
means that Undefined is considered greater than all other durations, including
Duration.Inf.

### `final class FiniteDuration extends Duration`                            ###

This class represents a finite duration. Its addition and subtraction operators
are overloaded to retain this guarantee statically. The range of this class is
limited to +-(2^63-1)ns, which is roughly 292 years.
