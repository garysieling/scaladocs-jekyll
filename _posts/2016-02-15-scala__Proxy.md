```scala
trait Proxy extends Any
```

This class implements a simple proxy that forwards all calls to the public,
non-final methods defined in class `Any` to another object self. Those methods
are:

```scala
def hashCode(): Int
def equals(other: Any): Boolean
def toString(): String
```

 *Note:* forwarding methods in this way will most likely create an asymmetric
equals method, which is not generally recommended.

### `def equals(that: Any): Boolean`                                         ###

Compares the receiver object ( `this` ) with the argument object ( `that` ) for
equivalence.

Any implementation of this method should be an
[equivalence relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation) :

* It is reflexive: for any instance `x` of type `Any` , `x.equals(x)` should
   return `true` .
* It is symmetric: for any instances `x` and `y` of type `Any` , `x.equals(y)`
   should return `true` if and only if `y.equals(x)` returns `true` .
* It is transitive: for any instances `x` , `y` , and `z` of type `Any` if
    `x.equals(y)` returns `true` and `y.equals(z)` returns `true` , then
    `x.equals(z)` should return `true` .

If you override this method, you should verify that your implementation remains
an equivalence relation. Additionally, when overriding this method it is usually
necessary to override `hashCode` to ensure that objects which are "equal" (
 `o1.equals(o2)` returns `true` ) hash to the same scala.Int. (
 `o1.hashCode.equals(o2.hashCode)` ).

* that
  * the object to compare against this object for equality.
* returns
  * `true` if the receiver object is equivalent to the argument; `false`
    otherwise.
