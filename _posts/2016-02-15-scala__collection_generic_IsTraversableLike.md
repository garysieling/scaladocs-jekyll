```scala
trait IsTraversableLike[Repr] extends AnyRef
```

A trait which can be used to avoid code duplication when defining extension
methods that should be applicable both to existing Scala collections (i.e.,
types extending `GenTraversableLike` ) as well as other (potentially
user-defined) types that could be converted to a Scala collection type. This
trait makes it possible to treat Scala collections and types that can be
implicitly converted to a collection type uniformly. For example, one can
provide extension methods that work both on collection types and on `String` s (
 `String` s do not extend `GenTraversableLike` , but can be converted to
 `GenTraversableLike` )

 `IsTraversable` provides two members:

1. type member `A` , which represents the element type of the target
    `GenTraversableLike[A, Repr]`
2. value member `conversion` , which provides a way to convert between the type
   we wish to add extension methods to, `Repr` , and
    `GenTraversableLike[A, Repr]` .

### Usage

One must provide `IsTraversableLike` as an implicit parameter type of an
implicit conversion. Its usage is shown below. Our objective in the following
example is to provide a generic extension method `mapReduce` to any type that
extends or can be converted to `GenTraversableLike` . In our example, this
includes `String` .

```scala
import scala.collection.GenTraversableLike
  import scala.collection.generic.IsTraversableLike

  class ExtensionMethods[A, Repr](coll: GenTraversableLike[A, Repr]) {
    def mapReduce[B](mapper: A => B)(reducer: (B, B) => B): B = {
      val iter = coll.toIterator
      var res = mapper(iter.next())
      while (iter.hasNext)
        res = reducer(res, mapper(iter.next()))
      res
    }
  }

  implicit def withExtensions[Repr](coll: Repr)(implicit traversable: IsTraversableLike[Repr]) =
    new ExtensionMethods(traversable.conversion(coll))

// See it in action!
List(1, 2, 3).mapReduce(_ * 2)(_ + _) // res0: Int = 12
"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.".mapReduce(x => 1)(_ + _) // res1: Int = 59
```

Here, we begin by creating a class `ExtensionMethods` which contains our
 `mapReduce` extension method. Note that `ExtensionMethods` takes a constructor
argument `coll` of type `GenTraversableLike[A, Repr]` , where `A` represents the
element type and `Repr` represents (typically) the collection type. The
implementation of `mapReduce` itself is straightforward.

The interesting bit is the implicit conversion `withExtensions` , which returns
an instance of `ExtensionMethods` . This implicit conversion can only be applied
if there is an implicit value `traversable` of type `IsTraversableLike[Repr]` in
scope. Since `IsTraversableLike` provides value member `conversion` , which
gives us a way to convert between whatever type we wish to add an extension
method to (in this case, `Repr` ) and `GenTraversableLike[A, Repr]` , we can now
convert `coll` from type `Repr` to `GenTraversableLike[A, Repr]` . This allows
us to create an instance of the `ExtensionMethods` class, which we pass our new
 `GenTraversableLike[A, Repr]` to.

When the `mapReduce` method is called on some type of which it is not a member,
implicit search is triggered. Because implicit conversion `withExtensions` is
generic, it will be applied as long as an implicit value of type
 `IsTraversableLike[Repr]` can be found. Given that `IsTraversableLike` contains
implicit members that return values of type `IsTraversableLike` , this
requirement is typically satisfied, and the chain of interactions described in
the previous paragraph is set into action. (See the `IsTraversableLike`
companion object, which contains a precise specification of the available
implicits.)

 _Note_ : Currently, it's not possible to combine the implicit conversion and
the class with the extension methods into an implicit class due to limitations
of type inference.

### Implementing `IsTraversableLike` for New Types

One must simply provide an implicit value of type `IsTraversableLike` specific
to the new type, or an implicit conversion which returns an instance of
 `IsTraversableLike` specific to the new type.

Below is an example of an implementation of the `IsTraversableLike` trait where
the `Repr` type is `String` .

```scala
implicit val stringRepr: IsTraversableLike[String] { type A = Char } =
  new IsTraversableLike[String] {
    type A = Char
    val conversion = implicitly[String => GenTraversableLike[Char, String]]
  }
```
