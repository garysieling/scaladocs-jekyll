Equivalent to `x.hashCode` except for boxed numeric types and `null` . For
numerics, it returns a hash value which is consistent with value equality: if
two value type instances compare as true, then ## will produce the same hash
value for each of them. For `null` returns a hashcode where `null.hashCode`
throws a `NullPointerException` .

### `def ++:[B >: A, That](that: collection.Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[collection.Traversable[(El1, El2)], B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the

    implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is found.

  * the traversable to append.

     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and and the new element

followed by the elements from the right hand operand. The element type of the

### `def /:[B](z: B)(op: (B, (El1, El2)) ⇒ B): B`                            ###

Applies a binary operator to a start value and all elements of this collection,
going left to right.

Note: `/:` is alternate syntax for `foldLeft` ; `z /: xs` is the same as
 `xs foldLeft z` .

Examples:

Note that the folding function used to compute b is equivalent to that used to
compute c.

```scala
scala> val a = List(1,2,3,4)
a: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val b = (5 /: a)(_+_)
b: Int = 15

scala> val c = (5 /: a)((x,y) => x + y)
c: Int = 15
```

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered. or the operator is associative and commutative.

* B
  * the result type of the binary operator.
* z
  * the start value.
* op
  * the binary operator.
* returns
  * the result of inserting `op` between consecutive elements of this
    collection, going left to right with the start value `z` on the left:

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, (El1, El2)) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B` ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the collection into partitions and processes each partition
by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like `foldLeft` ). Those
intermediate results are then combined by using `combop` (like `fold` ). The
implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary number of
collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an arbitrary number
of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

### `def collectFirst[B](pf: PartialFunction[(El1, El2), B]): Option[B]`     ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

Produces a collection containing cumulative results of applying the operator
going right to left. The head of the collection is the last cumulative result.

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

```scala
List(1, 2, 3, 4).scanRight(0)(_ + _) == List(10, 9, 7, 4, 0)
```

* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and and the new element
    type `B` .
* returns
