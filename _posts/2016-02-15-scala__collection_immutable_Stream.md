#                      scala.collection.immutable.Stream                      #

```scala
abstract class Stream[+A] extends AbstractSeq[A] with LinearSeq[A] with GenericTraversableTemplate[A, Stream] with LinearSeqOptimized[A, Stream[A]] with Serializable
```

The class `Stream` implements lazy lists where elements are only evaluated when
they are needed. Here is an example:

```scala
import scala.math.BigInt
object Main extends App {

  val fibs: Stream[BigInt] = BigInt(0) #:: BigInt(1) #:: fibs.zip(fibs.tail).map { n => n._1 + n._2 }

  fibs take 5 foreach println
}

// prints
//
// 0
// 1
// 1
// 2
// 3
```

The `Stream` class also employs memoization such that previously computed values
are converted from `Stream` elements to concrete values of type `A` . To
illustrate, we will alter body of the `fibs` value above and take some more
values:

```scala
import scala.math.BigInt
object Main extends App {

  val fibs: Stream[BigInt] = BigInt(0) #:: BigInt(1) #:: fibs.zip(
    fibs.tail).map(n => {
      println("Adding %d and %d".format(n._1, n._2))
      n._1 + n._2
    })

  fibs take 5 foreach println
  fibs take 6 foreach println
}

// prints
//
// 0
// 1
// Adding 0 and 1
// 1
// Adding 1 and 1
// 2
// Adding 1 and 2
// 3

// And then prints
//
// 0
// 1
// 1
// 2
// 3
// Adding 2 and 3
// 5
```

There are a number of subtle points to the above example.

* The definition of `fibs` is a `val` not a method. The memoization of the
    `Stream` requires us to have somewhere to store the information and a `val`
   allows us to do that.
* While the `Stream` is actually being modified during access, this does not
   change the notion of its immutability. Once the values are memoized they do
   not change and values that have yet to be memoized still "exist", they simply
   haven't been realized yet.
* One must be cautious of memoization; you can very quickly eat up large amounts
   of memory if you're not careful. The reason for this is that the memoization
   of the `Stream` creates a structure much like scala.collection.immutable.List.
   So long as something is holding on to the head, the head holds on to the
   tail, and so it continues recursively. If, on the other hand, there is
   nothing holding on to the head (e.g. we used `def` to define the `Stream` )
   then once it is no longer being used directly, it disappears.
* Note that some operations, including drop, dropWhile, flatMap or collect may
   process a large number of intermediate elements before returning. These
   necessarily hold onto the head, since they are methods on `Stream` , and a
   stream holds its own head. For computations of this sort where memoization is
   not desired, use `Iterator` when possible.

```scala
// For example, let's build the natural numbers and do some silly iteration
// over them.

// We'll start with a silly iteration
def loop(s: String, i: Int, iter: Iterator[Int]): Unit = {
  // Stop after 200,000
  if (i < 200001) {
    if (i % 50000 == 0) println(s + i)
    loop(s, iter.next, iter)
  }
}

// Our first Stream definition will be a val definition
val stream1: Stream[Int] = {
  def loop(v: Int): Stream[Int] = v #:: loop(v + 1)
  loop(0)
}

// Because stream1 is a val, everything that the iterator produces is held
// by virtue of the fact that the head of the Stream is held in stream1
val it1 = stream1.iterator
loop("Iterator1: ", it1.next, it1)

// We can redefine this Stream such that all we have is the Iterator left
// and allow the Stream to be garbage collected as required.  Using a def
// to provide the Stream ensures that no val is holding onto the head as
// is the case with stream1
def stream2: Stream[Int] = {
  def loop(v: Int): Stream[Int] = v #:: loop(v + 1)
  loop(0)
}
val it2 = stream2.iterator
loop("Iterator2: ", it2.next, it2)

// And, of course, we don't actually need a Stream at all for such a simple
// problem.  There's no reason to use a Stream if you don't actually need
// one.
val it3 = new Iterator[Int] {
  var i = -1
  def hasNext = true
  def next(): Int = { i += 1; i }
}
loop("Iterator3: ", it3.next, it3)
```

* The fact that `tail` works at all is of interest. In the definition of `fibs`
   we have an initial `(0, 1, Stream(...))` so `tail` is deterministic. If we
   defined `fibs` such that only `0` were concretely known then the act of
   determining `tail` would require the evaluation of `tail` which would cause
   an infinite recursion and stack overflow. If we define a definition where the
   tail is not initially computable then we're going to have an infinite
   recursion:

```scala
// The first time we try to access the tail we're going to need more
// information which will require us to recurse, which will require us to
// recurse, which...
val sov: Stream[Vector[Int]] = Vector(0) #:: sov.zip(sov.tail).map { n => n._1 ++ n._2 }
```

The definition of `fibs` above creates a larger number of objects than necessary
depending on how you might want to implement it. The following implementation
provides a more "cost effective" implementation due to the fact that it has a
more direct route to the numbers themselves:

```scala
lazy val fib: Stream[Int] = {
  def loop(h: Int, n: Int): Stream[Int] = h #:: loop(n, h + n)
  loop(1, 1)
}
```

Note that `mkString` forces evaluation of a `Stream` , but `addString` does not.
In both cases, a `Stream` that is or ends in a cycle (e.g.
 `lazy val s: Stream[Int] = 0 #:: s` ) will convert additional trips through the
cycle to `...` . Additionally, `addString` will display an un-memoized tail as
 `?` .

Composes this partial function with a transformation function that gets applied
to results of this partial function.

* C
  * the result type of the transformation function.

### `def applyOrElse[A1 <: Int, B1 >: A](x: A1, default: (A1) ⇒ B1): B1`     ###

Applies this partial function to the given argument when it is contained in the
function domain. Applies fallback function where this partial function is not
defined.

Note that expression `pf.applyOrElse(x, default)` is equivalent to

```scala
if(pf isDefinedAt x) pf(x) else default(x)
```

except that `applyOrElse` method can be implemented more efficiently. For all
partial function literals the compiler generates an `applyOrElse` implementation
which avoids double evaluation of pattern matchers and guards. This makes
 `applyOrElse` the basis for the efficient implementation for many operations
and scenarios, such as:

* combining partial functions into `orElse` / `andThen` chains does not lead to
   excessive `apply` / `isDefinedAt` evaluation
*  `lift` and `unlift` do not evaluate source functions twice on each invocation
*  `runWith` allows efficient imperative-style combining of partial functions
   with conditionally applied actions

For non-literal partial function classes with nontrivial `isDefinedAt` method it
is recommended to override `applyOrElse` with custom implementation that avoids
double `isDefinedAt` evaluation. This may result in better performance and more
predictable behavior w.r.t. side effects.

* x
  * the function argument
* default
  * the fallback function
* returns

Turns this partial function into a plain function returning an `Option` result.

### `def orElse[A1 <: Int, B1 >: A](that: PartialFunction[A1, B1]): PartialFunction[A1, B1]` ###

applied where this partial function is not defined.

* A1
  * the argument type of the fallback function
* B1
  * the result type of the fallback function
* that
  * the fallback function
* returns
  * a partial function which has as domain the union of the domains of this
    partial function and `that` . The resulting partial function takes `x` to
     `this(x)` where `this` is defined, and to `that(x)` where it is not.

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def runWith[U](action: (A) ⇒ U): (Int) ⇒ Boolean`                       ###

Composes this partial function with an action function which gets applied to
results of this partial function. The action function is invoked only for its
side effects; its result is ignored.

Note that expression `pf.runWith(action)(x)` is equivalent to

```scala
if(pf isDefinedAt x) { action(pf(x)); true } else false
```

except that `runWith` is implemented via `applyOrElse` and thus potentially more
efficient. Using `runWith` avoids double evaluation of pattern matchers and
guards for partial function literals.

* action
  * the action function
* returns
  * a function which maps arguments `x` to `isDefinedAt(x)` . The resulting
    function runs `action(this(x))` where `this` is defined.

### `def par: ParSeq[A]`                                                     ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

### `def combinations(n: Int): Iterator[Stream[A]]`                          ###

Iterates over combinations. A _combination_ of length `n` is a subsequence of
the original sequence, with the elements taken in order. Thus, `"xy"` and
 `"yy"` are both length-2 combinations of `"xyy"` , but `"yx"` is not. If there
is more than one way to generate the same subsequence, only one will be
returned.

For example, `"xyyy"` has three different ways to generate `"xy"` depending on
whether the first, second, or third `"y"` is selected. However, since all are
identical, only one will be chosen. Which of the three will be taken is an
implementation detail that is not defined.

* returns
  * An Iterator which traverses the possible n-element combinations of this

* from

### `def ++:[B >: A, That](that: collection.Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Stream[A], B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

### `def ++[B >: A, That](that: GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Stream[A], B, That]): That` ###

Create a new stream which contains all elements of this stream followed by all
elements of Traversable `that` .

* B
  * The element type of the returned collection. *That*
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the
    element type `B` being admissible for that class, which means that an
    implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is found.
* that
  * The scala.collection.GenTraversableOnce the be concatenated to this
     `Stream` .
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and the new element type
     `B` .
* returns
  * A new collection containing the result of concatenating `this` with `that` .

* Definition Classes
  * Stream → TraversableLike → GenTraversableLike
* Note
  * This method doesn't cause the `Stream` to be fully realized but it should be
    noted that using the `++` operator from another collection type could cause
    infinite realization of a `Stream` . For example, referring to the
    definition of `fibs` in the preamble, the following would never return:
     `List(BigInt(12)) ++ fibs` ., It's subtle why this works. We know that if
    the target type of the scala.collection.mutable.Builder `That` is either a
     `Stream` , or one of its supertypes, or undefined, then `StreamBuilder`
    will be chosen for the implicit. We recognize that fact and optimize to get
    more laziness.

(defined at scala.collection.immutable.Stream)


### `def +:[B >: A, That](elem: B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Stream[A], B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

A copy of the stream with an element prepended.

Note that :-ending operators are right associative (see example). A mnemonic for
 `+:` vs. `:+` is: the COLon goes on the COLlection side.

Also, the original stream is not modified, so you will want to capture the
result.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = 2 +: x
y: List[Int] = List(2, 1)

scala> println(x)
List(1)
```

* elem
  * the prepended element
* returns
  * a new stream consisting of `elem` followed by all elements of this stream.

### `def addString(b: mutable.StringBuilder, start: String, sep: String, end: String): mutable.StringBuilder` ###

Write all defined elements of this iterable into given string builder. The
written text begins with the string `start` and is finished by the string `end` .
Inside, the string representations of defined elements (w.r.t. the method
 `toString()` ) are separated by the string `sep` . The method will not force
evaluation of undefined elements. A tail of such elements will be represented by
a `"?"` instead. A cyclic stream is represented by a `"..."` at the point where
the cycle repeats.

* b
  * The collection.mutable.StringBuilder factory to which we need to add the
    string elements.
* start
  * The prefix of the resulting string (e.g. "Stream(")
* sep
  * The separator between elements of the resulting string (e.g. ",")
* end
  * The end of the resulting string (e.g. ")")
* returns
  * The original collection.mutable.StringBuilder containing the resulting
    string.

* returns
  * The stream containing elements of this stream and the traversable object.

stream on which the function is defined.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* pf
  * the partial function which filters and maps the stream.
* returns
  * a new stream resulting from applying the given partial function `pf` to each
    element on which it is defined and collecting the results. The order of the
    elements is preserved.

Builds a new stream from this stream in which any duplicates (as determined by
 `==` ) have been removed. Among duplicate elements, only the first one is
retained in the resulting `Stream` .

* returns
  * A new `Stream` representing the result of applying distinctness to the
    original `Stream` .

first element does not satisfy the predicate `p` .

* p
  * the test predicate.
* returns
  * A new `Stream` representing the results of applying `p` to the original
     `Stream` .

* Definition Classes
  * Stream → TraversableLike → GenTraversableLike
* Note
  * This method realizes the entire `Stream` beyond the truth value of the

### `final def flatMap[B, That](f: (A) ⇒ GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Stream[A], B, That]): That` ###

Applies the given function `f` to each element of this stream, then concatenates
the results. As with `map` this function does not need to realize the entire
 `Stream` but continues to keep it as a lazy `Stream` .

* B
  * The element type of the returned collection *That* .
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the
    element type `B` being admissible for that class, which means that an
    implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is found.
* f
  * the function to apply on each element.
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class

  * The type of the elements of the resulting `Stream` .
* asTraversable
  * an implicit conversion which asserts that the element type of this stream is
    a `GenTraversable` .
* returns
  * A new `Stream` of type `B` of the flattened elements of `this`  `Stream` .

Forces evaluation of the whole stream and returns it.

* returns
  * The fully realized `Stream` .

* Note
  * Often we use `Stream` s to represent an infinite set or series. If that's
    the case for your particular `Stream` then this function will never return
    and will probably crash the VM with an `OutOfMemory` exception. This
    function will not hang on a finite cycle, however.

### `final def foreach[U](f: (A) ⇒ U): Unit`                                 ###

Apply the given function `f` to each element of this linear sequence (while
respecting the order of the elements).

* U
  * the type parameter describing the result of function `f` . This result will
    always be ignored. Typically `U` is `Unit` , but this is not necessary.

* Note
  * This function will force the realization of the entire stream unless the
     `f` throws an exception., Overridden here as final to trigger tail-call

Returns the `n` first elements of this `Stream` as another `Stream` , or else
the whole `Stream` , if it has less than `n` elements.

The result of `take` is, again, a `Stream` meaning that it also does not make

Creates a non-strict view of this stream.

* returns
  * a non-strict view of this stream.

* Definition Classes
  * Stream → SeqLike → IterableLike → TraversableLike

### `final def withFilter(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): FilterMonadic[A, Stream[A]]`    ###

A FilterMonadic which allows GC of the head of stream during processing

* p
  * the predicate used to test elements.
* returns
  * an object of class `WithFilter` , which supports `map` , `flatMap` ,
     `foreach` , and `withFilter` operations. All these operations apply to
    those elements of this stream which satisfy the predicate `p` .

### `def zipWithIndex[A1 >: A, That](implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Stream[A], (A1, Int), That]): That` ###

Zips this iterable with its indices. `s.zipWithIndex` is equivalent to
 `s zip s.indices` .

This method is much like `zip` in that it returns a single lazy `Stream` of
scala.Tuple2.

* A1
  * The type of the first element of the scala.Tuple2 in the resulting stream.
* That
  * The type of the resulting `Stream` .
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and the new element type
     `(A1, Int)` .
* returns
  * `Stream({a0,0}, ..., {an,n)}`

* Definition Classes
  * Stream → IterableLike → GenIterableLike

Example:

```scala
def naturalsFrom(i: Int): Stream[Int] = i #:: naturalsFrom(i + 1)
(naturalsFrom(1) zipWithIndex) take 5 foreach println
// prints
// (1,0)
// (2,1)
// (3,2)
// (4,3)
// (5,4)
```

### `final def zip[A1 >: A, B, That](that: GenIterable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Stream[A], (A1, B), That]): That` ###

Returns a stream formed from this stream and the specified stream `that` by
associating each element of the former with the element at the same position in
the latter.

If one of the two streams is longer than the other, its remaining elements are
ignored.

The return type of this function may not be obvious. The lazy aspect of the
returned value is different than that of `partition` . In `partition` we get
back a scala.Tuple2 of two lazy `Stream` s whereas here we get back a single
lazy `Stream` of scala.Tuple2 s where the scala.Tuple2 's type signature is
 `(A1, B)` .

* A1
  * The type of the first parameter of the zipped tuple
* B
  * The type of the second parameter of the zipped tuple
* That
  * The type of the returned `Stream` .
* that
  * The iterable providing the second half of each result pair
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and the new element type
     `(A1, B)` .
* returns
  * `Stream({a0,b0}, ..., {amin(m,n),bmin(m,n))}` when
     `Stream(a0, ..., am) zip Stream(b0, ..., bn)` is invoked.

* Definition Classes
  * Stream → IterableLike → GenIterableLike

Example:

```scala
def naturalsFrom(i: Int): Stream[Int] = i #:: naturalsFrom(i + 1)
naturalsFrom(1) zip naturalsFrom(2) take 5 foreach println
// prints
// (1,2)
// (2,3)
// (3,4)
// (4,5)
// (5,6)
```
