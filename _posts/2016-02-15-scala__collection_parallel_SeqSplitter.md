### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, T) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

### `def setIndexFlagIfGreater(f: Int): Unit`                                ###

Sets the value of the index flag if argument is greater than current value. This
method does this atomically.

The index flag holds an integer which carries some operation-specific meaning.
For instance, `takeWhile` operation sets the index flag to the position of the
element where the predicate fails. Other workers may check this index against
the indices they are working on and return if this index is smaller than their
index. Examples of operations using this are `takeWhile` , `dropWhile` , `span`
and `indexOf` .

### `abstract def psplit(sizes: Int*): scala.Seq[SeqSplitter[T]]`            ###

Splits the splitter into disjunct views.

This overloaded version of the `split` method is specific to precise splitters.
It returns a sequence of splitters, each iterating some subset of the elements
in this splitter. The sizes of the subsplitters in the partition is equal to the
size in the corresponding argument, as long as there are enough elements in this
splitter to split it that way.

If there aren't enough elements, a zero element splitter is appended for each
additional argument. If there are additional elements, an additional splitter is
appended at the end to compensate.

For example, say we have a splitter `ps` with 100 elements. Invoking:

```scala
ps.split(50, 25, 25, 10, 5)
```

will return a sequence of five splitters, last two views being empty. On the
other hand, calling:

```scala
ps.split(50, 40)
```

will return a sequence of three splitters, last of them containing ten elements.

 *Note:* this method actually invalidates the current splitter.

Unlike the case with `split` found in splitters, views returned by this method
can be empty.

* sizes
  * the sizes used to split this split iterator into iterators that traverse
    disjunct subsets
* returns
  * a sequence of disjunct subsequence iterators of this parallel iterator

### `abstract def split: scala.Seq[SeqSplitter[T]]`                          ###

Splits the iterator into a sequence of disjunct views.

Returns a sequence of split iterators, each iterating over some subset of the
elements in the collection. These subsets are disjoint and should be
approximately equal in size. These subsets are not empty, unless the iterator is
empty in which case this method returns a sequence with a single empty iterator.
If the splitter has more than two elements, this method will return two or more
splitters.

Implementors are advised to keep this partition relatively small - two splitters
are already enough when partitioning the collection, although there may be a few
more.

 *Note:* this method actually invalidates the current splitter.

* returns
  * a sequence of disjunct iterators of the collection
