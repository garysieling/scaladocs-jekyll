```scala
trait TraversableOnce[+A] extends GenTraversableOnce[A]
```

A template trait for collections which can be traversed either once only or one
or more times.

This trait exists primarily to eliminate code duplication between `Iterator` and
 `Traversable` , and thus implements some of the common methods that can be
implemented solely in terms of foreach without access to a `Builder` . It also
includes a number of abstract methods whose implementations are provided by
 `Iterator` , `Traversable` , etc. It contains implementations common to
 `Iterators` and `Traversables` , such as folds, conversions, and other
operations which traverse some or all of the elements and return a derived
value. Directly subclassing `TraversableOnce` is not recommended - instead,
consider declaring an `Iterator` with a `next` and `hasNext` method, creating an
 `Iterator` with one of the methods on the `Iterator` object, or declaring a
subclass of `Traversable` .

### `def /:[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) ⇒ B): B`                                     ###

Applies a binary operator to a start value and all elements of this traversable

Note: `/:` is alternate syntax for `foldLeft` ; `z /: xs` is the same as
 `xs foldLeft z` .

Examples:

Note that the folding function used to compute b is equivalent to that used to
compute c.

```scala
scala> val a = List(1,2,3,4)
a: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val b = (5 /: a)(_+_)
b: Int = 15

scala> val c = (5 /: a)((x,y) => x + y)
c: Int = 15
```

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered or the operator is associative and commutative.

* B
  * the result type of the binary operator.
* z
  * the start value.
* op
  * the binary operator.

    ```scala
    op(...op(op(z, x_1), x_2), ..., x_n)
    ```

    where `x1, ..., xn` are the elements of this traversable or iterator.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered or the operator is associative and commutative.

Examples:

Note that the folding function used to compute b is equivalent to that used to

### `def addString(b: StringBuilder): StringBuilder`                         ###

written text consists of the string representations (w.r.t. the method
 `toString` ) of all elements of this traversable or iterator without any
separator string.

Example:

scala> val b = new StringBuilder()
b: StringBuilder =

scala> val h = a.addString(b)

```

(defined at scala.collection.TraversableOnce)


### `def addString(b: StringBuilder, sep: String): StringBuilder`            ###

separator string. The written text consists of the string representations
(w.r.t. the method `toString` ) of all elements of this traversable or iterator,
separated by the string `sep` .

scala> a.addString(b, ", ")
res0: StringBuilder = 1, 2, 3, 4
```

* b
  * the string builder to which elements are appended.
* sep

### `def addString(b: StringBuilder, start: String, sep: String, end: String): StringBuilder` ###

Appends all elements of this traversable or iterator to a string builder using
start, end, and separator strings. The written text begins with the string
 `start` and ends with the string `end` . Inside, the string representations
(w.r.t. the method `toString` ) of all elements of this traversable or iterator
are separated by the string `sep` .

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1,2,3,4)
a: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val b = new StringBuilder()
b: StringBuilder =

scala> a.addString(b , "List(" , ", " , ")")

```

* b
  * the string builder to which elements are appended.
* start
  * the starting string.

  * the separator string.

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

### `def collectFirst[B](pf: PartialFunction[A, B]): Option[B]`              ###

Finds the first element of the traversable or iterator for which the given
partial function is defined, and applies the partial function to it.

Note: may not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* pf
  * the partial function
* returns
  * an option value containing pf applied to the first value for which it is
    defined, or `None` if none exists.

```scala
Seq("a", 1, 5L).collectFirst({ case x: Int => x*10 }) = Some(10)
```

unordered collection, which key is in the resulting map is undefined.

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

* returns
  * a map of type `immutable.Map[T, U]` containing all key/value pairs of type
     `(T, U)` of this traversable or iterator.

* Definition Classes
  * TraversableOnce → GenTraversableOnce

(defined at scala.collection.TraversableOnce)


### `def toSet[B >: A]: immutable.Set[B]`                                    ###

Converts this traversable or iterator to a set.

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

* returns
  * a set containing all elements of this traversable or iterator.

* Definition Classes
  * TraversableOnce → GenTraversableOnce
