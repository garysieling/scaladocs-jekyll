```scala
final class StringBuilder extends AbstractSeq[Char] with CharSequence with IndexedSeq[Char] with StringLike[StringBuilder] with ReusableBuilder[Char, String] with Serializable
```

A builder for mutable sequence of characters. This class provides an API mostly
compatible with `java.lang.StringBuilder` , except where there are conflicts
with the Scala collections API (such as the `reverse` method.)

### `def andThen[C](k: (Char) ⇒ C): PartialFunction[Int, C]`                 ###

Composes this partial function with a transformation function that gets applied
to results of this partial function.

* C
  * the result type of the transformation function.
* k
  * the transformation function
* returns

    arguments `x` to `k(this(x))` .

* Definition Classes

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def applyOrElse[A1 <: Int, B1 >: Char](x: A1, default: (A1) ⇒ B1): B1`  ###

Applies this partial function to the given argument when it is contained in the
function domain. Applies fallback function where this partial function is not
defined.

Note that expression `pf.applyOrElse(x, default)` is equivalent to

```scala
if(pf isDefinedAt x) pf(x) else default(x)
```

except that `applyOrElse` method can be implemented more efficiently. For all
partial function literals the compiler generates an `applyOrElse` implementation
which avoids double evaluation of pattern matchers and guards. This makes
 `applyOrElse` the basis for the efficient implementation for many operations
and scenarios, such as:

* combining partial functions into `orElse` / `andThen` chains does not lead to
   excessive `apply` / `isDefinedAt` evaluation
*  `lift` and `unlift` do not evaluate source functions twice on each invocation
*  `runWith` allows efficient imperative-style combining of partial functions
   with conditionally applied actions

For non-literal partial function classes with nontrivial `isDefinedAt` method it
is recommended to override `applyOrElse` with custom implementation that avoids
double `isDefinedAt` evaluation. This may result in better performance and more
predictable behavior w.r.t. side effects.

* x
  * the function argument
* default
  * the fallback function
* returns
  * the result of this function or fallback function application.

### `def lift: (Int) ⇒ Option[Char]`                                         ###

Turns this partial function into a plain function returning an `Option` result.

* returns
  * a function that takes an argument `x` to `Some(this(x))` if `this` is
    defined for `x` , and to `None` otherwise.

  * PartialFunction
* See also
  * Function.unlift

### `def orElse[A1 <: Int, B1 >: Char](that: PartialFunction[A1, B1]): PartialFunction[A1, B1]` ###

Composes this partial function with a fallback partial function which gets
applied where this partial function is not defined.

* A1
  * the argument type of the fallback function
* B1
  * the result type of the fallback function
* that
  * the fallback function
* returns
  * a partial function which has as domain the union of the domains of this
    partial function and `that` . The resulting partial function takes `x` to
     `this(x)` where `this` is defined, and to `that(x)` where it is not.

* Definition Classes
  * PartialFunction

(defined at scala.PartialFunction)


### `def runWith[U](action: (Char) ⇒ U): (Int) ⇒ Boolean`                    ###

Composes this partial function with an action function which gets applied to
results of this partial function. The action function is invoked only for its
side effects; its result is ignored.

Note that expression `pf.runWith(action)(x)` is equivalent to

```scala
if(pf isDefinedAt x) { action(pf(x)); true } else false
```

except that `runWith` is implemented via `applyOrElse` and thus potentially more
efficient. Using `runWith` avoids double evaluation of pattern matchers and
guards for partial function literals.

* action
  * the action function
* returns
  * a function which maps arguments `x` to `isDefinedAt(x)` . The resulting
    function runs `action(this(x))` where `this` is defined.

  * PartialFunction
* Since
  * 2.10

Note: `c span p` is equivalent to (but possibly more efficient than)
 `(c takeWhile p, c dropWhile p)` , provided the evaluation of the predicate
 `p` does not cause any side-effects.

### `def par: ParSeq[Char]`                                                  ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

### `def +:[B >: Char, That](elem: B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[StringBuilder, B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

A copy of the string builder with an element prepended.

Note that :-ending operators are right associative (see example). A mnemonic for
 `+:` vs. `:+` is: the COLon goes on the COLlection side.

Also, the original string builder is not modified, so you will want to capture
the result.

scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = 2 +: x
y: List[Int] = List(2, 1)

scala> println(x)

scala> val b = a :+ 2
b: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

### `def combinations(n: Int): Iterator[StringBuilder]`                      ###

Iterates over combinations. A _combination_ of length `n` is a subsequence of
the original sequence, with the elements taken in order. Thus, `"xy"` and
 `"yy"` are both length-2 combinations of `"xyy"` , but `"yx"` is not. If there
is more than one way to generate the same subsequence, only one will be
returned.

For example, `"xyyy"` has three different ways to generate `"xy"` depending on
whether the first, second, or third `"y"` is selected. However, since all are
identical, only one will be chosen. Which of the three will be taken is an
implementation detail that is not defined.

* returns
  * An Iterator which traverses the possible n-element combinations of this
    sequence.

### `def ++:[B >: Char, That](that: collection.Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[StringBuilder, B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.

### `def ++:[B >: Char, That](that: TraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[StringBuilder, B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y

### `def ++[B >: Char, That](that: GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[StringBuilder, B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

Returns a new string builder containing the elements from the left hand operand
followed by the elements from the right hand operand. The element type of the
string builder is the most specific superclass encompassing the element types of
the two operands.

### `def flatMap[B, That](f: (Char) ⇒ GenTraversableOnce[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[StringBuilder, B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

builder and using the elements of the resulting collections.

For example:

```scala
def getWords(lines: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = lines flatMap (line => line split "\\W+")
```

The type of the resulting collection is guided by the static type of string
builder. This might cause unexpected results sometimes. For example:

```scala
// lettersOf will return a Seq[Char] of likely repeated letters, instead of a Set
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words flatMap (word => word.toSet)

// lettersOf will return a Set[Char], not a Seq
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words.toSet flatMap (word => word.toSeq)

// xs will be an Iterable[Int]
val xs = Map("a" -> List(11,111), "b" -> List(22,222)).flatMap(_._2)

// ys will be a Map[Int, Int]
val ys = Map("a" -> List(1 -> 11,1 -> 111), "b" -> List(2 -> 22,2 -> 222)).flatMap(_._2)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, Char) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`  ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop

### `def split(separator: Char): Array[String]`                              ###

Split this string around the separator character

If this string is the empty string, returns an array of strings that contains a
single empty string.

If this string is not the empty string, returns an array containing the
substrings terminated by the start of the string, the end of the string or the
separator character, excluding empty trailing substrings

If the separator character is a surrogate character, only split on matching
surrogate characters if they are not part of a surrogate pair

The behaviour follows, and is implemented in terms of
[String.split(re: String)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split%28java.lang.String%29)

//empty string
"".split('.') //returns Array("")
//only trailing empty substrings are removed
"a.".split('.') //returns Array("a")
".a.".split('.') //returns Array("", "a")
"..a..".split('.') //returns Array("", "", "a")
//all parts are empty and trailing
".".split('.') //returns Array()
"..".split('.') //returns Array()
//surrogate pairs
val high = 0xD852.toChar
val low = 0xDF62.toChar
val highstring = high.toString
val lowstring = low.toString
//well-formed surrogate pairs are not split
