### `def equals(that: Any): Boolean`                                         ###

Compares the receiver object ( `this` ) with the argument object ( `that` ) for
equivalence.

Any implementation of this method should be an
[equivalence relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation) :

* It is reflexive: for any instance `x` of type `Any` , `x.equals(x)` should
   return `true` .
* It is symmetric: for any instances `x` and `y` of type `Any` , `x.equals(y)`
   should return `true` if and only if `y.equals(x)` returns `true` .
* It is transitive: for any instances `x` , `y` , and `z` of type `Any` if
    `x.equals(y)` returns `true` and `y.equals(z)` returns `true` , then
    `x.equals(z)` should return `true` .

If you override this method, you should verify that your implementation remains
an equivalence relation. Additionally, when overriding this method it is usually
necessary to override `hashCode` to ensure that objects which are "equal" (
 `o1.equals(o2)` returns `true` ) hash to the same scala.Int. (
 `o1.hashCode.equals(o2.hashCode)` ).

* that
  * the object to compare against this object for equality.
* returns
  * `true` if the receiver object is equivalent to the argument; `false`
    otherwise.

iterable collection by combining corresponding elements in pairs. If one of the
two collections is shorter than the other, placeholder elements are used to
extend the shorter collection to the length of the longer.

### `def par: ParIterable[A]`                                                ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

* returns
  * a parallel implementation of this collection

### `def ++:[B >: A, That](that: Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Iterable[A], B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = LinkedList(2)
y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* That
  * the class of the returned collection. Where possible, `That` is the same
    class as the current collection class `Repr` , but this depends on the
    element type `B` being admissible for that class, which means that an
    implicit instance of type `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is found.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and and the new element
    type `B` .
* returns
  * a new collection of type `That` which contains all elements of this
    traversable collection followed by all elements of `that` .

operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

* B

    collection followed by all elements of `that` .

Iterates over the inits of this traversable collection. The first value will be
this traversable collection and the final one will be an empty traversable
collection, with the intervening values the results of successive applications
of `init` .

* returns

Iterates over the tails of this traversable collection. The first value will be
this traversable collection and the final one will be an empty traversable
collection, with the intervening values the results of successive applications
of `tail` .

* returns

### `def withFilter(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): FilterMonadic[A, Iterable[A]]`        ###

Creates a non-strict filter of this traversable collection.

Note: the difference between `c filter p` and `c withFilter p` is that the
former creates a new collection, whereas the latter only restricts the domain of
subsequent `map` , `flatMap` , `foreach` , and `withFilter` operations.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* p
  * the predicate used to test elements.
* returns

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, A) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition

  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

### `def /:[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) ⇒ B): B`                                     ###

Applies a binary operator to a start value and all elements of this traversable
collection, going left to right.

Note: `/:` is alternate syntax for `foldLeft` ; `z /: xs` is the same as
 `xs foldLeft z` .

Examples:

Note that the folding function used to compute b is equivalent to that used to
compute c.

```scala
scala> val a = List(1,2,3,4)
a: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val b = (5 /: a)(_+_)
b: Int = 15

scala> val c = (5 /: a)((x,y) => x + y)
c: Int = 15
```

Produces a collection containing cumulative results of applying the operator
going right to left. The head of the collection is the last cumulative result.

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

Example:

```scala
List(1, 2, 3, 4).scanRight(0)(_ + _) == List(10, 9, 7, 4, 0)
```

* B
  * the type of the elements in the resulting collection
* That
  * the actual type of the resulting collection
* z
  * the initial value
* op
  * the binary operator applied to the intermediate result and the element
* bf
  * an implicit value of class `CanBuildFrom` which determines the result class
     `That` from the current representation type `Repr` and and the new element
    type `B` .
* returns
  * collection with intermediate results

### `def slice(from: Int, until: Int): Iterable[A]`                          ###

Selects an interval of elements. The returned collection is made up of all
elements `x` which satisfy the invariant:

```scala
from <= indexOf(x) < until
```

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* returns
  * a traversable collection containing the elements greater than or equal to
    index `from` extending up to (but not including) index `until` of this
    traversable collection.

### `def span(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): (Iterable[A], Iterable[A])`                 ###

Splits this traversable collection into a prefix/suffix pair according to a
predicate.

Note: `c span p` is equivalent to (but possibly more efficient than)
 `(c takeWhile p, c dropWhile p)` , provided the evaluation of the predicate
 `p` does not cause any side-effects.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* returns
  * a pair consisting of the longest prefix of this traversable collection whose
    elements all satisfy `p` , and the rest of this traversable collection.

### `def splitAt(n: Int): (Iterable[A], Iterable[A])`                        ###

Splits this traversable collection into two at a given position. Note:
 `c splitAt n` is equivalent to (but possibly more efficient than)
 `(c take n, c drop n)` .

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* n
  * the position at which to split.
* returns
  * a pair of traversable collections consisting of the first `n` elements of
    this traversable collection, and the other elements.

### `def tail: Iterable[A]`                                                  ###

Selects all elements except the first.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* returns
  * a traversable collection consisting of all elements of this traversable
    collection except the first one.

* Definition Classes
  * TraversableProxyLike → TraversableLike → GenTraversableLike

Selects first _n_ elements.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* n
  * the number of elements to take from this traversable collection.
* returns
  * a traversable collection consisting only of the first `n` elements of this
    traversable collection, or else the whole traversable collection, if it has
    less than `n` elements.

### `def takeWhile(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): Iterable[A]`                           ###

Takes longest prefix of elements that satisfy a predicate.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* returns
  * the longest prefix of this traversable collection whose elements all satisfy
    the predicate `p` .

### `def toIndexedSeq: immutable.IndexedSeq[A]`                              ###

Converts this traversable collection to an indexed sequence.

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

* returns
  * an indexed sequence containing all elements of this traversable collection.

(defined at scala.collection.TraversableProxyLike)


### `def toMap[T, U](implicit ev: <:<[A, (T, U)]): immutable.Map[T, U]`      ###

[use case]

Converts this iterable collection to a map. This method is unavailable unless
the elements are members of Tuple2, each ((T, U)) becoming a key-value pair in
the map. Duplicate keys will be overwritten by later keys: if this is an
unordered collection, which key is in the resulting map is undefined.

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

* returns
  * a map of type `immutable.Map[T, U]` containing all key/value pairs of type
     `(T, U)` of this iterable collection.

### `def toSet[B >: A]: immutable.Set[B]`                                    ###

Converts this traversable collection to a set.

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

* returns
  * a set containing all elements of this traversable collection.

### `def transpose[B](implicit asTraversable: (A) ⇒ GenTraversableOnce[B]): Iterable[Iterable[B]]` ###

Transposes this collection of traversable collections into a collection of
collections.

The resulting collection's type will be guided by the static type of collection.
For example:

```scala
val xs = List(
           Set(1, 2, 3),
           Set(4, 5, 6)).transpose
// xs == List(
//         List(1, 4),
//         List(2, 5),
//         List(3, 6))

val ys = Vector(
           List(1, 2, 3),
           List(4, 5, 6)).transpose
// ys == Vector(
//         Vector(1, 4),
//         Vector(2, 5),
//         Vector(3, 6))
```

* B
  * the type of the elements of each traversable collection.
* asTraversable
  * an implicit conversion which asserts that the element type of this
    collection is a `Traversable` .
* returns
  * a two-dimensional collection of collections which has as _n_ th row the _n_
    th column of this collection.
