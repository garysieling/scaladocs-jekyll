```scala
trait ParIterableLike[+T, +Repr <: ParIterable[T], +Sequential <: scala.Iterable[T] with IterableLike[T, Sequential]] extends GenIterableLike[T, Repr] with CustomParallelizable[T, Repr] with Parallel with HasNewCombiner[T, Repr]
```

A template trait for parallel collections of type `ParIterable[T]` .

This is a base trait for Scala parallel collections. It defines behaviour common
to all parallel collections. Concrete parallel collections should inherit this
trait and `ParIterable` if they want to define specific combiner factories.

Parallel operations are implemented with divide and conquer style algorithms
that parallelize well. The basic idea is to split the collection into smaller
parts until they are small enough to be operated on sequentially.

All of the parallel operations are implemented as tasks within this trait. Tasks
rely on the concept of splitters, which extend iterators. Every parallel
collection defines:

```scala
def splitter: IterableSplitter[T]
```

which returns an instance of `IterableSplitter[T]` , which is a subtype of
 `Splitter[T]` . Splitters have a method `remaining` to check the remaining
number of elements, and method `split` which is defined by splitters. Method
 `split` divides the splitters iterate over into disjunct subsets:

```scala
def split: Seq[Splitter]
```

which splits the splitter into a sequence of disjunct subsplitters. This is
typically a very fast operation which simply creates wrappers around the
receiver collection. This can be repeated recursively.

Tasks are scheduled for execution through a
scala.collection.parallel.TaskSupport object, which can be changed through the
 `tasksupport` setter of the collection.

Method `newCombiner` produces a new combiner. Combiners are an extension of
builders. They provide a method `combine` which combines two combiners and
returns a combiner containing elements of both combiners. This method can be
implemented by aggressively copying all the elements into the new combiner or by
lazily binding their results. It is recommended to avoid copying all of the
elements for performance reasons, although that cost might be negligible
depending on the use case. Standard parallel collection combiners avoid copying
when merging results, relying either on a two-step lazy construction or specific
data-structure properties.

Methods:

```scala
def seq: Sequential
def par: Repr
```

produce the sequential or parallel implementation of the collection,
respectively. Method `par` just returns a reference to this parallel collection.
Method `seq` is efficient - it will not copy the elements. Instead, it will
create a sequential version of the collection using the same underlying data
structure. Note that this is not the case for sequential collections in general
- they may copy the elements and produce a different underlying data structure.

The combination of methods `toMap` , `toSeq` or `toSet` along with `par` and
 `seq` is a flexible way to change between different collection types.

Since this trait extends the `GenIterable` trait, methods like `size` must also
be implemented in concrete collections, while `iterator` forwards to `splitter`
by default.

Each parallel collection is bound to a specific fork/join pool, on which dormant
worker threads are kept. The fork/join pool contains other information such as
the parallelism level, that is, the number of processors used. When a collection
is created, it is assigned the default fork/join pool found in the
 `scala.parallel` package object.

Parallel collections are not necessarily ordered in terms of the `foreach`
operation (see `Traversable` ). Parallel sequences have a well defined order for
iterators - creating an iterator and traversing the elements linearly will
always yield the same order. However, bulk operations such as `foreach` , `map`
or `filter` always occur in undefined orders for all parallel collections.

Existing parallel collection implementations provide strict parallel iterators.
Strict parallel iterators are aware of the number of elements they have yet to
traverse. It's also possible to provide non-strict parallel iterators, which do
not know the number of elements remaining. To do this, the new collection
implementation must override `isStrictSplitterCollection` to `false` . This will
make some operations unavailable.

To create a new parallel collection, extend the `ParIterable` trait, and
implement `size` , `splitter` , `newCombiner` and `seq` . Having an implicit
combiner factory requires extending this trait in addition, as well as providing
a companion object, as with regular collections.

Method `size` is implemented as a constant time operation for parallel
collections, and parallel collection operations rely on this assumption.

The higher-order functions passed to certain operations may contain
side-effects. Since implementations of bulk operations may not be sequential,
this means that side-effects may not be predictable and may produce data-races,
deadlocks or invalidation of state if care is not taken. It is up to the
programmer to either avoid using side-effects or to use some form of
synchronization when accessing mutable data.

[use case]

Returns a new parallel iterable containing the elements from the left hand
operand followed by the elements from the right hand operand. The element type
of the parallel iterable is the most specific superclass encompassing the
element types of the two operands.

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = List(2)
b: List[Int] = List(2)

scala> val c = a ++ b
c: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

scala> val d = List('a')
d: List[Char] = List(a)

scala> val e = c ++ d
e: List[AnyVal] = List(1, 2, a)
```

* B
  * the element type of the returned collection.
* that
  * the traversable to append.
* returns
  * a new parallel iterable which contains all elements of this parallel
    iterable followed by all elements of `that` .

### `def /:[S](z: S)(op: (S, T) ⇒ S): S`                                     ###

Applies a binary operator to a start value and all elements of this parallel
iterable, going left to right.

Note: `/:` is alternate syntax for `foldLeft` ; `z /: xs` is the same as
 `xs foldLeft z` .

Examples:

Note that the folding function used to compute b is equivalent to that used to
compute c.

```scala
scala> val a = List(1,2,3,4)
a: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4)

scala> val b = (5 /: a)(_+_)
b: Int = 15

scala> val c = (5 /: a)((x,y) => x + y)
c: Int = 15
```

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered. or the operator is associative and commutative.

* z
  * the start value.
* op
  * the binary operator.
* returns
  * the result of inserting `op` between consecutive elements of this parallel
    iterable, going left to right with the start value `z` on the left:

    ```scala
    op(...op(op(z, x_1), x_2), ..., x_n)
    ```

    where `x1, ..., xn` are the elements of this parallel iterable.

### `def :\[S](z: S)(op: (T, S) ⇒ S): S`                                     ###

Applies a binary operator to all elements of this parallel iterable and a start
value, going right to left.

Note: `:\` is alternate syntax for `foldRight` ; `xs :\ z` is the same as
 `xs foldRight z` .

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered. or the operator is associative and commutative.

c: Int = 15

    op(x_1, op(x_2, ... op(x_n, z)...))
    ```

### `def aggregate[S](z: ⇒ S)(seqop: (S, T) ⇒ S, combop: (S, S) ⇒ S): S`     ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It has similar semantics,
but does not require the result to be a supertype of the element type. It
traverses the elements in different partitions sequentially, using `seqop` to
update the result, and then applies `combop` to results from different
partitions. The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions, so `combop` may be invoked arbitrary number of
times.

For example, one might want to process some elements and then produce a `Set` .
In this case, `seqop` would process an element and append it to the set, while
 `combop` would concatenate two sets from different partitions together. The
initial value `z` would be an empty set.

```scala
pc.aggregate(Set[Int]())(_ += process(_), _ ++ _)
```

Another example is calculating geometric mean from a collection of doubles (one
would typically require big doubles for this).

* S
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

elements `x` which satisfy the invariant:

```scala
from <= indexOf(x) < until
```

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

### `def span(pred: (T) ⇒ Boolean): (Repr, Repr)`                            ###

Splits this parallel iterable into a prefix/suffix pair according to a
predicate.

This method will use `indexFlag` signalling capabilities. This means that
splitters may set and read the `indexFlag` state. The index flag is initially
set to maximum integer value.

* pred
  * the predicate used to test the elements
* returns
  * a pair consisting of the longest prefix of the collection for which all the
    elements satisfy `pred` , and the rest of the collection

### `def splitAt(n: Int): (Repr, Repr)`                                      ###

Splits this parallel iterable into two at a given position. Note: `c splitAt n`
is equivalent to (but possibly more efficient than) `(c take n, c drop n)` .

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* n
  * the position at which to split.
* returns
  * a pair of parallel iterables consisting of the first `n` elements of this
    parallel iterable, and the other elements.

Note: might return different results for different runs, unless the underlying
collection type is ordered.

* n
  * the number of elements to take from this parallel iterable.
* returns
  * a parallel iterable consisting only of the first `n` elements of this
    parallel iterable, or else the whole parallel iterable, if it has less than
     `n` elements.

### `def tasksupport_=(ts: TaskSupport): Unit`                               ###

Changes the task support object which is responsible for scheduling and
load-balancing tasks to processors.

A task support object can be changed in a parallel collection after it has been
created, but only during a quiescent period, i.e. while there are no concurrent
invocations to parallel collection methods.

Here is a way to change the task support of a parallel collection:

```scala
import scala.collection.parallel._
val pc = mutable.ParArray(1, 2, 3)
pc.tasksupport = new ForkJoinTaskSupport(
  new java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool(2))
```

Converts this parallel iterable to an iterable collection. Note that the choice
of target `Iterable` is lazy in this default implementation as this
 `TraversableOnce` may be lazy and unevaluated (i.e. it may be an iterator which
is only traversable once).

Note: will not terminate for infinite-sized collections.

### `def toMap[K, V](implicit ev: <:<[T, (K, V)]): immutable.ParMap[K, V]`   ###

[use case]

Converts this parallel iterable to a map. This method is unavailable unless the
elements are members of Tuple2, each ((T, U)) becoming a key-value pair in the
