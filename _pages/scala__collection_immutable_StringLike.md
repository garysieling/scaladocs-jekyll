shorter than the other, placeholder elements are used to extend the shorter
collection to the length of the longer.

### `def par: ParSeq[Char]`                                                  ###

Returns a parallel implementation of this collection.

For most collection types, this method creates a new parallel collection by
copying all the elements. For these collection, `par` takes linear time. Mutable
collections in this category do not produce a mutable parallel collection that
has the same underlying dataset, so changes in one collection will not be
reflected in the other one.

Specific collections (e.g. `ParArray` or `mutable.ParHashMap` ) override this
default behaviour by creating a parallel collection which shares the same
underlying dataset. For these collections, `par` takes constant or sublinear
time.

All parallel collections return a reference to themselves.

* returns
  * a parallel implementation of this collection

### `def +:[B >: Char, That](elem: B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That` ###

[use case]

A copy of the string with an element prepended.

Note that :-ending operators are right associative (see example). A mnemonic for
 `+:` vs. `:+` is: the COLon goes on the COLlection side.

Also, the original string is not modified, so you will want to capture the
result.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)
x: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val y = 2 +: x
y: List[Int] = List(2, 1)

scala> println(x)
List(1)

Example:

```scala
scala> val a = List(1)
a: List[Int] = List(1)

scala> val b = a :+ 2
b: List[Int] = List(1, 2)

### `def combinations(n: Int): Iterator[Repr]`                               ###

Iterates over combinations. A _combination_ of length `n` is a subsequence of
the original sequence, with the elements taken in order. Thus, `"xy"` and
 `"yy"` are both length-2 combinations of `"xyy"` , but `"yx"` is not. If there
is more than one way to generate the same subsequence, only one will be
returned.

For example, `"xyyy"` has three different ways to generate `"xy"` depending on
whether the first, second, or third `"y"` is selected. However, since all are
identical, only one will be chosen. Which of the three will be taken is an
implementation detail that is not defined.

* returns
  * An Iterator which traverses the possible n-element combinations of this
    sequence.

* Definition Classes
  * SeqLike

```scala
"abbbc".combinations(2) = Iterator(ab, ac, bb, bc)

### `def ++:[B >: Char, That](that: collection.Traversable[B])(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That` ###

As with `++` , returns a new collection containing the elements from the left
operand followed by the elements from the right operand.

It differs from `++` in that the right operand determines the type of the
resulting collection rather than the left one. Mnemonic: the COLon is on the
side of the new COLlection type.

Example:

```scala
scala> val x = List(1)

y: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(2)

scala> val z = x ++: y
z: scala.collection.mutable.LinkedList[Int] = LinkedList(1, 2)
```

This overload exists because: for the implementation of `++:` we should reuse
that of `++` because many collections override it with more efficient versions.

Since `TraversableOnce` has no `++` method, we have to implement that directly,
but `Traversable` and down can use the overload.

def getWords(lines: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = lines flatMap (line => line split "\\W+")
```

The type of the resulting collection is guided by the static type of string.
This might cause unexpected results sometimes. For example:

```scala
// lettersOf will return a Seq[Char] of likely repeated letters, instead of a Set
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words flatMap (word => word.toSet)

// lettersOf will return a Set[Char], not a Seq
def lettersOf(words: Seq[String]) = words.toSet flatMap (word => word.toSeq)

// xs will be an Iterable[Int]
val xs = Map("a" -> List(11,111), "b" -> List(22,222)).flatMap(_._2)

// ys will be a Map[Int, Int]
val ys = Map("a" -> List(1 -> 11,1 -> 111), "b" -> List(2 -> 22,2 -> 222)).flatMap(_._2)
```

### `def aggregate[B](z: ⇒ B)(seqop: (B, Char) ⇒ B, combop: (B, B) ⇒ B): B`  ###

Aggregates the results of applying an operator to subsequent elements.

This is a more general form of `fold` and `reduce` . It is similar to
 `foldLeft` in that it doesn't require the result to be a supertype of the
element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed in
chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.

 `aggregate` splits the traversable or iterator into partitions and processes
each partition by sequentially applying `seqop` , starting with `z` (like
 `foldLeft` ). Those intermediate results are then combined by using `combop`
(like `fold` ). The implementation of this operation may operate on an arbitrary
number of collection partitions (even 1), so `combop` may be invoked an
arbitrary number of times (even 0).

As an example, consider summing up the integer values of a list of chars. The
initial value for the sum is 0. First, `seqop` transforms each input character
to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then, `combop` just needs
to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

```scala
List('a', 'b', 'c').aggregate(0)({ (sum, ch) => sum + ch.toInt }, { (p1, p2) => p1 + p2 })
```

* B
  * the type of accumulated results
* z
  * the initial value for the accumulated result of the partition - this will
    typically be the neutral element for the `seqop` operator (e.g. `Nil` for
    list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated more than once
* seqop
  * an operator used to accumulate results within a partition
* combop
  * an associative operator used to combine results from different partitions

Result of comparing `this` with operand `that` .

Implement this method to determine how instances of A will be sorted.

Returns `x` where:

### `def format(args: Any*): String`                                         ###

Uses the underlying string as a pattern (in a fashion similar to printf in C),
and uses the supplied arguments to fill in the holes.

The interpretation of the formatting patterns is described in
`java.util.Formatter`, with the addition that classes deriving from
 `ScalaNumber` (such as scala.BigInt and scala.BigDecimal) are unwrapped to pass
a type which `Formatter` understands.

* args
  * the arguments used to instantiating the pattern.

* Exceptions thrown

### `def formatLocal(l: Locale, args: Any*): String`                         ###

Like `format(args*)` but takes an initial `Locale` parameter which influences
formatting as in `java.lang.String` 's format.

The interpretation of the formatting patterns is described in
`java.util.Formatter`, with the addition that classes deriving from
 `ScalaNumber` (such as `scala.BigInt` and `scala.BigDecimal` ) are unwrapped to
pass a type which `Formatter` understands.

* l
  * an instance of `java.util.Locale`

### `def r(groupNames: String*): Regex`                                      ###

You can follow a string with `.r(g1, ... , gn)` , turning it into a `Regex` ,
with group names g1 through gn.

 `"""(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)""".r("month", "day", "year")` matches dates and
provides its subcomponents through groups named "month", "day" and "year".

* groupNames
  * The names of the groups in the pattern, in the order they appear.

### `def r: Regex`                                                           ###

You can follow a string with `.r` , turning it into a `Regex` . E.g.

 `"""A\w*""".r` is the regular expression for identifiers starting with `A` .

(defined at scala.collection.immutable.StringLike)


### `def replaceAllLiterally(literal: String, replacement: String): String`  ###

Replace all literal occurrences of `literal` with the string `replacement` .
This is equivalent to java.lang.String#replaceAll except that both arguments are
appropriately quoted to avoid being interpreted as metacharacters.

* literal
  * the string which should be replaced everywhere it occurs
* replacement
  * the replacement string
* returns
  * the resulting string

### `def slice(from: Int, until: Int): Repr`                                 ###

Selects an interval of elements. The returned collection is made up of all
elements `x` which satisfy the invariant:

```scala
from <= indexOf(x) < until
```

* returns
  * a string containing the elements greater than or equal to index `from`
    extending up to (but not including) index `until` of this string.

(defined at scala.collection.immutable.StringLike)


### `def split(separator: Char): Array[String]`                              ###

Split this string around the separator character

If this string is the empty string, returns an array of strings that contains a
single empty string.

If this string is not the empty string, returns an array containing the
substrings terminated by the start of the string, the end of the string or the
separator character, excluding empty trailing substrings

If the separator character is a surrogate character, only split on matching
surrogate characters if they are not part of a surrogate pair

The behaviour follows, and is implemented in terms of
[String.split(re: String)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split%28java.lang.String%29)

* separator
  * the character used as a delimiter

Example:

```scala
"a.b".split('.') //returns Array("a", "b")
//splitting the empty string always returns the array with a single
//empty string
"".split('.') //returns Array("")
//only trailing empty substrings are removed
"a.".split('.') //returns Array("a")
".a.".split('.') //returns Array("", "a")
"..a..".split('.') //returns Array("", "", "a")
//all parts are empty and trailing
".".split('.') //returns Array()
"..".split('.') //returns Array()
//surrogate pairs
val high = 0xD852.toChar
val low = 0xDF62.toChar
val highstring = high.toString
val lowstring = low.toString
//well-formed surrogate pairs are not split
val highlow = highstring + lowstring
highlow.split(high) //returns Array(highlow)
//bare surrogate characters are split
val bare = "_" + highstring + "_"
bare.split(high) //returns Array("_", "_")
```

### `def stripPrefix(prefix: String): String`                                ###

Returns this string with the given `prefix` stripped. If this string does not
start with `prefix` , it is returned unchanged.

(defined at scala.collection.immutable.StringLike)


### `def stripSuffix(suffix: String): String`                                ###

Returns this string with the given `suffix` stripped. If this string does not
end with `suffix` , it is returned unchanged.
