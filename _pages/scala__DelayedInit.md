```scala
trait DelayedInit extends AnyRef
```

Classes and objects (but note, not traits) inheriting the `DelayedInit` marker
trait will have their initialization code rewritten as follows: `code` becomes
 `delayedInit(code)` .

Initialization code comprises all statements and all value definitions that are
executed during initialization.

Example:

```scala
trait Helper extends DelayedInit {
  def delayedInit(body: => Unit) = {
    println("dummy text, printed before initialization of C")
    body // evaluates the initialization code of C
  }
}

class C extends Helper {
  println("this is the initialization code of C")
}

object Test extends App {
  val c = new C
}
```

Should result in the following being printed:

```scala
dummy text, printed before initialization of C
this is the initialization code of C
```

* Annotations
  * @ deprecated
* Deprecated
  * _(Since version 2.11.0)_ DelayedInit semantics can be surprising. Support
    for `App` will continue. See the release notes for more details:
